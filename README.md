> **Build#thon 2026 — Idea A: Grounded AI Assistant for Bihar Government Schools**

---

## 1. Problem Statement Mapping
In over 70,000 government schools across Bihar, two systemic challenges persist:
1. **The Student Doubt Dilemma:** In multi-grade rural classrooms (pupil-teacher ratios often exceeding 40:1), first-generation learners frequently hesitate to ask doubts due to social shyness or language barriers. When studying at home by lantern or dim bulb, they have no one to ask.
2. **The Teacher's Evening Dilemma:** Dedicated government school teachers spend hours every evening manually writing lesson plans, drafting blackboard diagrams, formulating quizzes, and hand-marking papers—leaving little time for targeted student mentoring.
3. **The LLM Hallucination Threat:** General-purpose AI models hallucinate facts or pull high-school/college level content far beyond the prescribed state textbook curriculum.

**Gurukul AI solves this by building an AI assistant strictly grounded in the school's own textbook chapter text.**
- **Zero Hallucinations:** Every student answer is verified server-side against the chapter section. If a quote is not a verbatim substring, the answer is flagged or rejected.
- **Off-Chapter Guardrails:** Questions outside the textbook (e.g., *"Who won the cricket match?"*) receive a polite refusal in Hindi and English with a 1-click option to forward to the teacher's inbox.
- **Teacher Evening Saver:** Instant 30/40/45-minute lesson plans whose timed steps add up *exactly* to the period length, alongside 5 server-verified multiple-choice questions with full answer keys.
- **Code-Computed Telemetry:** Class mastery, weakest topic identification (Saprotrophs at 52%), and remedial groups are computed in deterministic TypeScript code—never hallucinated by an LLM.

## 7. 5 Likely Judge Questions & Answers

1. **Q: How do you guarantee the model won't hallucinate non-existent science facts?**
   **A:** *Gurukul AI does not use open-ended prompting or vector databases with loose similarity thresholds. The entire chapter text is provided to Gemini with strict JSON schemas. On the backend, we run programmatic string normalization and verify that the cited quote is a verbatim substring of that exact textbook section. If the quote is missing or modified, the answer is rejected.*

2. **Q: How does this work for students in rural Bihar who have no laptops or high-speed Wi-Fi?**
   **A:** *Gurukul AI is designed mobile-first as an offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA). It has large touch targets, supports Hindi voice input via the browser's built-in Web Speech API (`hi-IN`), and caches the latest lesson plans and quizzes for offline study in low-connectivity areas.*

3. **Q: Why are your mastery stats computed in code rather than by the LLM?**
   **A:** *LLMs are probabilistic and prone to arithmetic drift. For high-stakes educational assessments and district reporting, math must be deterministic. The 240 quiz records from `quiz_results.csv` are aggregated directly in TypeScript via SQLite queries, ensuring that the 52.00% class mean and the 4 students below 40% are mathematically exact.*

4. **Q: What happens if a teacher wants to teach a new chapter not currently in the app?**
   **A:** *The app is completely dynamic. Through the "+ Upload Your Own Chapter" modal, a teacher can paste text or snap a photo of a textbook page. Gemini 3.8 Flash Vision parses the image into numbered sections, making the new chapter immediately available for lesson plans, quizzes, and doubt clearing.*

5. **Q: How do you protect student privacy?**
   **A:** *We follow privacy-by-design. Students log in with a simple Roll Number and Class Code without passwords. No personally identifiable phone numbers or biometric data are collected. Furthermore, parent WhatsApp reports require explicit teacher approval before being dispatched.*

## 8. Known Limitations & Future Scope

- **Current Limitations:**
  - Voice speech synthesis depends on browser-supported TTS voices; low-end browsers may use fallback voices.
  - Image OCR requires reasonable lighting and legible print for optimal extraction.
- **Future Scope:**
  - Native integration with Bihar's *e-LOTS* (electronic Library of Teachers and Students) portal.
  - Regional language expansion into Maithili, Bhojpuri, and Magahi voice models.
  - Bluetooth peer-to-peer quiz synchronization between teacher phones and student devices without active internet.
